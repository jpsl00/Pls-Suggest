# Simple Suggestion Bot
#### This bot was just a coding challenge to see how fast I could do it

# Hosting
To host your own instance you'll need a `.env` file such as the one below
```
TOKEN = the bot's token
CHANNEL_ID = the id of the suggestion channel
UPVOTE = the id of the upvote emote
DOWNVOTE = the id of the downvote emote
```
Then run `npm start` or `node .` to start the bot
